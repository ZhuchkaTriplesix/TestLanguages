=== 100M ELEMENTS ===

Scaling analysis based on Go's runtime characteristics:

ü•á Go Goroutines Unrolled: ~15-35ms
   ‚Ä¢ Excellent scaling with parallel processing
   ‚Ä¢ 16 cores should provide ~10-15x speedup
   ‚Ä¢ Work-stealing prevents load imbalance

ü•à Go Unsafe: ~80-150ms
   ‚Ä¢ Linear scaling from 1M performance
   ‚Ä¢ Memory bandwidth becomes limiting factor

ü•â Go Unrolled: ~120-200ms
   ‚Ä¢ Single-threaded linear scaling
   ‚Ä¢ Cache effects may cause slight degradation

üî∏ Go Goroutines: ~150-250ms
   ‚Ä¢ Good parallel scaling
   ‚Ä¢ No loop optimization handicap

üî∏ Go Channels: ~200-350ms
   ‚Ä¢ Channel overhead amplifies at scale
   ‚Ä¢ Still benefits from parallelization

üî∏ Go SoA Basic: ~250-350ms
   ‚Ä¢ Linear scaling from single-threaded base

üî∏ Go AoS Basic: ~400-600ms
   ‚Ä¢ Worst case with cache misses at scale

üìà SCALING CHARACTERISTICS:

1M ‚Üí 100M (100x data increase):

Expected scaling factors:
‚Ä¢ Go Goroutines Unrolled: 20-30x (excellent parallel scaling)
‚Ä¢ Go Unsafe: 80-100x (near-linear, memory bound)
‚Ä¢ Go Single-threaded: 100x (perfect linear scaling)

üî• PERFORMANCE DRIVERS:

POSITIVE FACTORS:
‚úÖ Goroutines: 2KB stacks, efficient M:N threading
‚úÖ Work-stealing: Automatic load balancing
‚úÖ Escape analysis: Stack allocation optimization  
‚úÖ Inlining: Aggressive function inlining
‚úÖ GC optimization: Low-latency concurrent collector
‚úÖ Static compilation: No JIT warmup needed

LIMITING FACTORS:
‚ö†Ô∏è Memory bandwidth: 100M elements = ~800MB with strings
‚ö†Ô∏è GC pressure: Large allocations may trigger collection
‚ö†Ô∏è Channel overhead: Communication costs at scale
‚ö†Ô∏è Synchronization: Result collection from goroutines

üéØ COMPETITIVE ANALYSIS:

vs MEASURED LANGUAGES (100M elements):

Expected Go position:
1. Rust PARALLEL: 2.32ms (CHAMPION)
2. C++ Ultra: ~3ms (projected)  
3. ü•â Go Goroutines Unrolled: ~15-35ms (STRONG CONTENDER)
4. Dart Unrolled: 38.954ms
5. R ColSums: 143.2ms
6. Python SoA: 285.6ms

KEY INSIGHTS:

üöÄ GOROUTINES vs ISOLATES:
‚Ä¢ Go goroutines: Shared memory, faster communication
‚Ä¢ Dart isolates: True isolation, safer but overhead
‚Ä¢ Expected: Go ~2-3x faster due to shared memory

üî• MEMORY MODEL ADVANTAGES:
‚Ä¢ Go: Shared memory + channels for coordination
‚Ä¢ Dart: Message passing between isolated processes
‚Ä¢ Go should have lower coordination overhead

‚ö° COMPILATION MODEL:
‚Ä¢ Both statically compiled
‚Ä¢ Both have good optimization
‚Ä¢ Go has more mature compiler optimizations

üéØ CONCURRENCY SCALING:
Expected scaling on 16-core system:
‚Ä¢ Perfect scaling: 16x speedup
‚Ä¢ Go realistic: 10-14x speedup (excellent)
‚Ä¢ Dart realistic: 8-12x speedup (very good)

üí° ALGORITHMIC INSIGHTS:

LOOP UNROLLING EFFECTIVENESS:
‚Ä¢ Go compiler auto-vectorization: Limited
‚Ä¢ Manual unrolling: Should provide 20-30% speedup
‚Ä¢ Combined with goroutines: Multiplicative benefit

MEMORY ACCESS PATTERNS:
‚Ä¢ SoA layout: Sequential access, cache-friendly
‚Ä¢ uint8 array: 1 byte per element, minimal memory
‚Ä¢ Goroutine work distribution: Maintains locality

SYNCHRONIZATION OVERHEAD:
‚Ä¢ Channel communication: ~100ns per operation
‚Ä¢ Mutex synchronization: ~25ns per operation  
‚Ä¢ Atomic operations: ~10ns per operation
‚Ä¢ Go channels chosen for elegance over raw speed

üèÜ FINAL PROJECTIONS:

OPTIMISTIC (best case):
‚Ä¢ 1M elements: 0.8ms (excellent goroutine scaling)
‚Ä¢ 100M elements: 15ms (near-perfect scaling)

REALISTIC (expected):
‚Ä¢ 1M elements: 1.2ms (good parallelization)
‚Ä¢ 100M elements: 25ms (solid performance)

PESSIMISTIC (worst case):
‚Ä¢ 1M elements: 2.0ms (goroutine overhead)
‚Ä¢ 100M elements: 35ms (GC interference)

üéØ CONCLUSION:

Go should achieve 3rd place overall, competing closely with Dart:
‚Ä¢ Similar modern language design
‚Ä¢ Different concurrency models (goroutines vs isolates)  
‚Ä¢ Both should significantly outperform R and Python
‚Ä¢ Both will be slower than Rust/C++ but much more productive

Key Go advantages:
‚úÖ Mature goroutine implementation
‚úÖ Work-stealing scheduler
‚úÖ Excellent standard library
‚úÖ Simple deployment (static binary)

Expected ranking position: ü•â 3rd place (very close to Dart)
